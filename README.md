An OCR pipeline project in Python

## Why does this repo exist?

The ultimate goal of this repo is to develop an OCR pipeline for extracting relevant text from a set of screenshots/images. 

Along the way we will document the ideas, missteps and choices made throughout the evolution of the project. Check out the project [Wiki](https://github.com/leemthompo/screen-shot/wiki) for documentation, project roadmap and design decisions.
