# screen-shot

An OCR pipeline project in Python

## Why does this repo exist?

The ultimate goal of this repo is to develop an OCR pipeline for extracting relevant text from a set of screenshots/images. 

Along the way we will document the ideas, missteps and choices made throughout the evolution of the project.

## First step

The [first script](https://github.com/leemthompo/screen-shot/blob/main/screenshot_parse.py) committed to the repo is a command-line tool, where we pass the name of the HTML file (generated by Screenotate [the underlying OCR program](https://screenotate.com/)). The Python script uses Beautiful Soup to parse the tags, a simple regex to remove the HTML tags, and then copies the relevant text to the clipboard.

## Second step

The next step is to turn this script into a daemon (ðŸ˜ˆ ) that:

1. Wakes up periodically
1. Searches for any HTML files in the relevant folder
1. Runs the OCR
1. Spits the text into a working buffer
1. Deletes the HTML file. 

This will remove several manual steps and be the first real step in creating a **pipeline** process, rather than a one-time script run.
