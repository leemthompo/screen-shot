An OCR pipeline project in Python

## Why does this repo exist?
The ultimate goal of this repo is to develop an OCR pipeline for extracting relevant text from a set of screenshots/images. Parallel to this, we will document the ideas, missteps and choices made throughout the evolution of the project.

## First step
The [first script](link.com) committed to the repo is a command-line tool, where we pass the name of the HTML file (generated by the underlying OCR program). The Python script uses a simple regex to find the HTML tags, Beautiful Soup to parse the tags and then copies the relevant text to the clipboard.
